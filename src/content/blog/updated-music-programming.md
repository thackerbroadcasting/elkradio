We're in the process of updating our music programming. In the past, we've mirror our sister station [Z96 The Mix](https://z96mix.com), which has allowed us to share the same music library.

Going forward, we're going to be defining our own twist on that same music library by altering our programming. We'll still be playing your favorites (you can always let us know over on the [request](../request) page) but we'll be changing from an "all-over-the-place" selection to a more defined and clear station. We'll continue broadcasting in the meantime, just expect our lineup to begin shifting over the coming weeks.

This process can take a while, and we'll be keeping you updated right here! You can always connect with us on our socials (listed on the [home](/) page) to let us know what we're doing good, bad, ugly, and anything in-between.
