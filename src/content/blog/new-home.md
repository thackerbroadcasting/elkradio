We have found ourselves with a new website! Hosted on more robust and flexible infrastructure that works as hard as we do, this website will serve as our new home. If you haven't already, bookmark us so you remember how to find us (by the way, it's [z96mix.com](https://z96mix.com)).

Thank you so much for sticking through all the craziness that has happened with us the last couple of years. Partnering with Thacker Broadcasting has been a fantastic move in the right direction in making our services easier to access and more robust than ever before. We hope we're the first thing that comes to mind when you think of radio.
